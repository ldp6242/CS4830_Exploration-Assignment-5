CS4830_Exploration-Assignment-5
===============================

JavaScript
For this Exploration Assignment I decided to work on JavaScript. After interviewing at multiple companies this was one of the langueages they expected candidates to know. I had a brief overview of what javascript was beforehand but I wanted to go deeper into the topcic to learn more about the language. So far I learned how to make prompts and confirm users input as well as making my own fucntions. I really like the style of javascript and can't wait to learn more and expand my knowledge.
